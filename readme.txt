Gives administrators the ability to add notes to posts of any post type (including pages) that are prominently displayed for users editing the site.

== Description ==

Have you ever created a page template that just aggregated posts of a custom post type? Pretty cool huh? 

Well, your client won’t think it’s that cool 2 months from now when they’re editing their site. They click “edit page” *and it’s blank!*.

Now you can add notes and links on these pages that will give your clients clear directions when editing their site. Check out the screenshots to see it in action.
